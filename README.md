### Final Project Proposal

In the digital age, there is a tremendous surplus of sexual content online, while visibility of sex works (and their rights) is becoming increasingly relevant. The amount of online activity around sexual content has the potential to have real-world, particularly harmful implications, as the lives of sex workers could be exploited or endangered. Online pornographic content has also severe implications for how content consumers perceive women (note that the term women in this context is used to refer to women regardless of their sex assigned at birth). A brief literature search we conducted suggests that sexual online content and the public discourse around it in platforms offering pornographic content is severely understudied, while the only computationally significant studies of such content are conducted by the platforms themselves.

Our research questions are:

1. In what ways do people interact with sex workers online?
2. To what extent is there sexism in these interactions? Are they positive? Negative? Or even nasty?
Hence, we plan on building a large-scale web-scraping and data processing pipeline on AWS to scrape comments on pornographic videos from Pornhub, one of the largest porn websites in the world. We would further train sexism detector NLP models to evaluate the amount of sexism prevalent in porn website comments. Lastly, we will analyze the comments using sentiment classifiers to explore the overall public sentiment expressed in pornographic platforms.

The tasks will be divided as follows:

- Data collection and processing: Loizos and Kaya
- NLP modelling: Kaya and Joe
- Sentiment analysis: Joe and Loizos
